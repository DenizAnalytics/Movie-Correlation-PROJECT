Project README

This is a README file for a project that involves data analysis of a movies dataset. The project uses Python and various libraries to perform data manipulation, exploration, and visualization.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a movies dataset and gain insights into the relationship between movie budgets and gross earnings. The dataset contains information such as movie names, ratings, genres, release years, scores, votes, directors, writers, stars, countries, budgets, gross earnings, and more.

The project involves the following steps:

Importing the required packages: The project requires the following packages: pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot.
Reading in the data: The movies dataset is stored in a CSV file, and it is read into a pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. The file path is specified as "/Users/denizisik/Downloads/movies.csv".
Checking for missing data: A loop is used to iterate over the columns of the DataFrame and calculate the percentage of missing values in each column. The results are printed to the console.
Handling missing data: Any rows with missing values are dropped from the DataFrame using the dropna() function.
Adjusting data types: The data types of the 'budget' and 'gross' columns are converted to int64 using the astype() function.
Creating a new column: A new column called 'yearcorrect' is created by extracting the year from the 'released' column using regular expressions.
Sorting the data: The DataFrame is sorted in descending order based on the 'gross' column using the sort_values() function.
Visualizing the data: A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between movie budgets and gross earnings. The 'budget' column is plotted on the x-axis, and the 'gross' column is plotted on the y-axis.
Getting Started

To run this project, follow the steps below:

Install the required packages: Make sure you have the pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib packages installed. You can install them using pip or conda.
Download the dataset: Download the movies dataset in CSV format and save it as "movies.csv" in the specified file path ("/Users/denizisik/Downloads/movies.csv").
Open the project file: Open a Python script or Jupyter Notebook and import the required packages.
Copy and paste the code: Copy the code from the README file and paste it into your project file.
Run the code: Run the code to import the data, perform data manipulation, and generate visualizations.
Results

The project performs various data manipulations and visualizations to analyze the movies dataset. It checks for missing data, handles missing values, adjusts data types, sorts the data, and creates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between movie budgets and gross earnings.

The results of the analysis can be observed by running the code and examining the output and visualizations.

Conclusion

This project provides a basic framework for analyzing a movies dataset and exploring the relationship between movie budgets and gross earnings. It can be extended and customized based on specific requirements and further analysis.
